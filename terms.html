    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Effective Date: February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="alert">
        NOTICE REGARDING PAYMENTS: All digital purchases are processed via the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. By making a purchase, you agree to their terms as well as these Vibekiss Terms.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to create an account. Vibekiss is for personal use only; commercial use or "prostitution/escorting" solicitation will result in an immediate permanent ban without refund.</p>

    <div class="payment-box">
        <h2>2. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Vibekiss offers premium features ("Vibekiss Plus/Gold") and virtual currency ("Coins").</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the billing period (monthly/yearly) at the then-current price. To avoid charges for the next period, you must cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Prices may vary by region and platform. We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Goods (Coins):</strong> "Coins" or "Credits" are digital licenses with no cash value. They are non-transferable and expire if your account is inactive for 12 months.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing Disputes:</strong> Because payments are handled by Apple/Google, you must contact their support for billing issues or refund requests.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Cancellation & Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Generally, all purchases are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>UK Users:</strong> In accordance with the <em>Consumer Contracts Regulations</em>, you have a 14-day "Cooling Off" period. However, if you use a premium feature (e.g., send a "Super Like" or see who liked you), you acknowledge that you waive your right to a refund for that period.</li>
        <li><strong>US Users:</strong> Refunds are at the sole discretion of the App Store/Play Store provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Ban:</strong> If your account is terminated for violating our safety rules (harassment, fake profile, etc.), you are <strong>not entitled</strong> to a refund of any unused subscription time or Coins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Safety & The "Online Safety Act" (UK)</h2>
    <p>We are legally required to protect users from "Priority Content" offences. 
        <ul>
            <li>Sending unsolicited sexual images (Cyberflashing) is a crime.</li>
            <li>Using AI to generate "Deepfake" images of other users is strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li>Violations will be reported to the National Crime Agency (UK) or relevant US authorities.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Vibekiss is provided "as is." We do not guarantee you will find a partner. We are not liable for any emotional distress, financial loss from scams, or physical harm resulting from offline meetings. <strong>Always meet in public places.</strong></p>

    <div class="alert" style="background: #fdfdfd;">
